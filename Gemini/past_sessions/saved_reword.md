We discussed setting up a persistent context for the Gemini CLI agent using a `GEMINI.md` file. We then established a convention for a 'save session' command, where the user provides a summary of the current work, which is then saved to a timestamped Markdown file in a `past_sessions` directory within `C:\Users\Ckrest\Documents\Gemini\`.
