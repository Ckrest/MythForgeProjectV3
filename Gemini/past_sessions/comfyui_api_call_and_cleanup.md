## Session Summary: ComfyUI API Call and Cleanup

This session focused on successfully making an API call to ComfyUI and then cleaning up the project directory.

**Key actions performed:**

*   **ComfyUI API Call:**
    *   Initial attempts to use `curl` for the ComfyUI API call failed due to issues with file path handling in the `curl` command on Windows.
    *   A Python script (`send_workflow_direct.py`) was created and refined to handle the API call more robustly, including proper JSON loading and error handling.
    *   Successfully sent the `Anime Random Workflow v1 exported.json` workflow to the ComfyUI API, queuing a prompt.

*   **File Cleanup:**
    *   Identified and removed several unnecessary files from the project directory, including `Anime Random Workflow v1.json`, `rename_session_file.py`, `send_comfy_workflow.py`, `temp_workflow.json`, `write_json_temp_v2.py`, and `write_json_temp.py`.
    *   A Python script (`delete_temp_files.py`) was used to ensure robust deletion of files with spaces in their names.

*   **Context Update:**
    *   The `GEMINI.md` file was updated to reflect the current project purpose, key technologies, important files, and specific instructions for making ComfyUI API calls using the `send_workflow_direct.py` script.

**Outcome:**

*   A functional Python script for ComfyUI API interaction is in place.
*   The project directory is cleaner and more organized.
*   The `GEMINI.md` provides clear, updated instructions for future reference.
